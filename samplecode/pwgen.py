    Generate a random password of length `length`, in which the
    fraction `special_frac` consists of characters other than 
    lowercase letters.  The character classes available for these
    other characters are controlled by the flags:
      `require_capital` : Capital letters (A-Z)
      `require_symbol` : Symbols (!@#$%^&*()-+=_)
      `require_digit` : Digits (0-9)
    Each of these flags also adds a requirement that at least
    one character from that class must be present.

    If all the `require_*` flags are False, then `special_frac`
    is ignored and a random password of lowercase letters is
    returned.
