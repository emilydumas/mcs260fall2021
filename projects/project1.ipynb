    "This section will explain a mathematical process that is used in the program you'll write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose `n` is a positive integer.  For the purposes of this project, we use the term **largest digit** of `n` to refer the decimal digit appearing in `n` that has the largest value.  For example\n",
    "* The largest digit of `100` is `1`\n",
    "* The largest digit of `5284` is `8`\n",
    "* The largest digit of `620` is `6`\n",
    "* The largest digit of `1200000000` is `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we'll call the number of digits in a number `n` its **length** (again, for this project; this isn't standard terminology).  For example:\n",
    "* The length of `100` is `3`\n",
    "* The length of `8` is `1`\n",
    "* The length of `5284` is `4`\n",
    "* The length of `1200000000` is `10`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now, the essential definition:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from a given integer `n` we define a new integer `m` as follows:  Take the largest digit of `n` and call it `d`.  Then, take the length of `n` and call it `k`.  Then `m` is defined to be the result of adding `n` and `d**k` and then integer-dividing by 2.  We call `m` the **mean with digit power** (MWDP) of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "* Start with `n = 5284`\n",
    "* The largest digit is `d=8`\n",
    "* The length of `n` is `k=4`\n",
    "* `d**k = 8**4 = 4096`\n",
    "* The sum of `5284` and `4096` is `9380`\n",
    "* Integer dividing `9380` by `2` gives `m=4690`\n",

    "\n",
    "That is, if we are given a starting integer $n_0$, we can define an infinite sequence of integers $n_i$ by the rule that $n_{i+1}$ is the mean with digit power of $n_{i}$.  We call this the **mean with digit power sequence** (or MWDPS)\n",
