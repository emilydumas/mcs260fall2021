    "\n",
    "In this project you will write a *text adventure game* that follows certain specifications.  This type of game, which is also known as *interactive fiction*, is based on printing a description of a situation and waiting for the user to enter a command that specifies their next action.  The situation changes based on the user's action and the process begins again (unless the user action triggers a win or loss). In outline form, the operation of a simple game of this type looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize variables to store the world map and current state of the game\n",
    "2. Display information about the player's location\n",
    "3. Determine whether the game is supposed to end right now (e.g. win or loss); if so, print a message and exit\n",
    "4. Wait for the user to enter a command (e.g. \"north\")\n",
    "5. Modify the game state to reflect the action indicated by the user command (e.g. change location).  If the game rules prohibit the user from performing the requested action, print a message to that effect.\n",
    "6. Return to step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "While most text adventure games have a concept of objects that can be picked up and used for some purposes in the game, the simple game you'll write for this project lacks these features.  It will only support actions that move the user from one place to another.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# MCS 260 Fall 2021 Project 2\n",
    "# Full Name\n",
    "# Individual work declaration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second line, replace `Full Name` with your full name.\n",

    "In the third line, replace `Individual work declaration` with a single full sentence, written in your own words, explaining that you completed the project individually and followed the rules in the syllabus and project description.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Use of docstrings\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of functions\n",

    "Your program must a function to load the world map from the JSON file.  This function should take a filename as its only argument, and return a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have other functions in your program, but this is not required.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Use good variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to choose variable names that communicate a variable's purpose in a concise way, but without being too terse.  Uninformative low-effort names like `intvar` or `mystring` are not acceptable.  Single-letter variable names can be used, but sparingly, and should usually be avoided for lists or other complex data structures.  Most of the time, a good variable name will be a single word or compound word, like `location` or `nextroom` or `worldmap`, but descriptive multiword names like `required_rooms_not_visited` are also acceptable.\n",

    "3. Operational tests (several tests, **40 points total**): The autograder will run your program with several different test maps (which will follow the specifications above, but which are not available to you in advance).  For each one, it will test various actions and check whether your program matches the expected behavior.  When the autograder is released, you can see the full list of tests by submitting code to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual review: 5 points\n",
    "\n",
    "I will review your code and look for adherence to the style guidelines given above, and examine your method of solving the problem.  If I see that your program does not do what was requested in this document, but the error was not detected in the automated testing, a deduction may be given at this point.  The scores assigned by the autograder will not be changed during manual review unless I discover some kind of intentional wrongdoing (such as an attempt to circumvent or reverse-engineer the autograder's operation)."

    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't open files for writing\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program only needs to **read** the world map, so you'll want to open it with mode `\"r\"`.  If you open it for writing, the contents will be erased and you'll need to download or extract the starter pack again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't submit any world maps on Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program needs to load whatever map is specified on the command line.  The autograder will test it on several maps, and you won't have access to these in advance.  While you definitely want to use sample maps like `map1.json` and `map2.json` from the starter pack while you're testing your project, you shouldn't submit these.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Printing long strings is OK\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of a room in the world map is often a long string.  Printing it will typically result in wrapping around to multiple lines in the terminal, with some words split between the end of one line and the start of the next.  You don't need to perform any word wrapping or do anything else to make this look nicer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Always test locally\n",
    "\n",
    "As you write your project, test it locally on your own computer or the lab computer you use for your work.  That is, run it in powershell or Terminal and make sure it works.  It is *much* harder to debug a broken program based solely on reports you get from the autograder compared to working with your local Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There might not be any \"mustvisit\" rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "It is valid to have a world map with none of the rooms marked \"mustvisit\".  A map like this will behave more like a maze: To win, the user only needs to find their way to a room that triggers a win.\n",
