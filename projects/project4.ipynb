Uninformative low-effort names like `intvar` or `mystring` are not acceptable.  Single-letter variable names can be used, but sparingly, and should usually be avoided for lists or other complex data structures.  Most of the time, a good variable name will be a single word, compound word, or multiword name with `_` separators, e.g. `upcoming_events` or `ingredients` or `cyclelength`.\n",

If you know that your program requires one of these platforms (and doesn't work on the other), that should be indicated in the `README.txt` file.  The program's operation must not depend on any system-specific details such as the exact operating system version, the user name, or the name of the directory in which the program is run.  If you have an explicit directory name in your code, such as `C:\\Users\\jdoe47\\Documents\\mcs260\\project4`, that probably won't work on my computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you develop on MacOS, it is *very* likely that your program will run on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 with no changes.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Your program must not alter or write any files except:\n",
    "* Files in the current working directory, or any subdirectory thereof\n",

    "\n",
    "### Not a standard exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming projects (e.g. write a tic-tac-toe game) are so often assigned in introductory courses that hundreds of solutions and lots of related discussion can be found online.  If you propose one of these \"standard\" topics, you will be asked to choose another topic or revise your proposal significantly.  Basically, if an idea shows up prominently in a web search for something like \"Python beginner project ideas\", it will probably not be acceptable.  This kind of web search is permissible to decide whether to rule out a project idea.\n",

You are **not required to use one of these**, and proposals based on a completely different topic of your own choosing are welcome.  You are also free to modify any aspect of one of these ideas when you create your proposal, but be careful to avoid making a project idea dramatically simpler than the ones listed here.  If your proposal falls below a certain minimum complexity threshold, I will request that you revise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanded geometry module** - Add several new shapes to the `geometry.py` module we built in Lecture.  Also make it so that all shapes support addition to compute the bounding box of a pair of objects.  Include a script demonstrating the features along with the module itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interactive fiction** - An expanded version of project 2 where you add additional features to the interactive fiction and create your own custom map.  For example, you might add an inventory system, so the game has a concept of \"objects\" that can be present in rooms, can be picked up using commands, and which may be required to complete certain actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Catalog**  - A program to catalog a collection (e.g. of books), storing its data in a file (e.g. CSV).  The program would use a  keyboard interface and offer commands to locate (search), print, modify, and delete records.  The search command should allow searching for text contained in a specified field, e.g. find all books whose title contains \"shark\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A basic Python web application** - *This would only work if you have existing knowledge of HTML that you want to apply in this project.*  Building on the Python API example from lecture 35, make a Python application that serves an HTML document meant to be viewed in the browser.  The document should be dynamically generated and support interaction of some kind, so that the same could not be easily achieved with a static HTML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Todo list** - A program that maintains a list of tasks and due dates.  It can display tasks in the order added, or in order of how soon they are due.  It supports adding or removing tasks, or changing the deadline for a task.  The task list is stored in a file, so that it is maintained between different sessions of running the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Open data analysis** - Use public data sets from a source such as the Chicago Data Portal, the Illinois Data Portal, data.gov, or a federal agency.  Write programs to extract useful information from these data sets and display or save it in a convenient format.  Document exactly where you downloaded the datasets, and what commands are used to process each one.  Example: List the street names of Chicago in order of decreasing numbers of parking tickets issued in 2018.  Document what you learned from your analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random text** - The program accepts an input text file which should be a very large document written in a natural language (e.g. English).  A novel from Project Gutenberg would be a good start.  It then produces a bunch of \"random\" text where the likelihood of any two words appearing next to each other is similar to the input file (but where the actual words are selected randomly).  This output text will be meaningless, but at a quick glance it might look like real prose.  (This project requires some learning or knowledge of probability and statistics.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Code filer** - Imagine someone has a directory (e.g. `mcs260`) full of Python source files for various purposes:\n",
    "   * Sample code from lectures\n",
    "   * Work from worksheet problems\n",
    "   * Work on homework assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "  Write a program that finds all such `.py` files and examines each one to try to determine where it should be filed in a more organized storage scheme, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If the filename looks like `worksheet6prob2.py` or `ws6prob2.py`, or if it has a name like `asdf.py` but mentions Worksheet 6 in a comment, then it should go in a directory named `worksheet6`\n",
    "   * Similarly for homework, where either filename or comment within the file would signal which assignment it belongs to\n",
    "   * If the patterns above don't apply, but if it contains a comment mentioning some Lecture number, then it should be filed in a directory corresponding to the week of class containing that lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "  The program would be expected to copy files (e.g. using `shutil.copyfile`) to new locations, rather than moving them.  A good way to handle this would be to have the current directory with all the `.py` files and the new directory where an organized hierarchy is to be created given as two command line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python source stats** - A program that reads a single Python source file and prints some statistics about the contents, including the number of lines that are not blank and not entirely comments (true \"source lines\"), the number of function definitions, number of function calls, the average and maximum line length, etc..  You could use the regular expression module to search for function definitions, or learn about parsing Python source in Python using the `ast` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recursively find large files** - Recursively search through a directory specified on the command line for files and then print a list of all files found in order of increasing size.  For each one, also indicate a percentage of the total size of all files found that it accounts for.  Also report on all the directories found in the search, indicating the total size of each directory's contents (the sum of sizes of all files it contains), with directories listed in order of increasing size.  Also allow the user to specify a minimum size (e.g. as a second command line argument) so that no items smaller than this theshold are printed.  Read about `os.stat()` to learn how to get the size of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Net present value calculator** - Build a tool for analyzing projected profit/loss data for a company taking into account inflation.  On the command line, the user provides an input file name and a list of estimated rates of inflation for the next few years.  The file should contain a list of estimated profits (positive numbers) or losses (negative numbers), with each line corresponding to one year.  The program then computes and prints the net present value of the income stream.  (Note: Requires knowledge or learning of the concept of net present value!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Personal expense tracker** - A simple program for tracking personal income and expenses.  It stores data in a JSON file, and when run prompts the user for commands.  Commands can specify spending (with amount, category, and optional date) or income to be recorded, or can ask for a summary of spending and income for the last month, year, or other time period.  Such a summary would indicate spending in each category and total spending, each in absolute numbers and as a fraction of income for the same period.  (Note: Handling dates/times will be a tricky part of this project, and we don't cover that until Lecture 37.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fake code typist** - A program that lets an actor who doesn't know Python appear to be typing Python code in the terminal for cinematic purposes.  First, learn how to detect individual key presses in the terminal in Windows or Linux.  Then, make a program that will allow the user to type garbage text (random letters) on the keyboard and have nice Python source code show up on the screen.  One character of source code should appear for each key pressed.  The code displayed should come from some pre-loaded sample code files that are written by you, are provided as examples in MCS 260, or are in the public domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recipe multiplier / unit converter** - A program that reads the ingredients for a cooking recipe from a text file, with lines like `11 oz powdered bhut jolokia chilies` or `1.5 c butter` and extracts the quantity, unit, and ingredient name from each line.  Then, upon request, the program can do any of these things: (1) Convert from US/imperial units (cup, ounce, pound,...) to metric units (ml, g, ...),  (2) Convert from metric to US/imperial units, (3) Multiply the recipe quantities by a given float (e.g. double or halve).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Location guessing game** - A one-player game displays a grid using text printed to the terminal.  Each square in the grid might contain an obstacle (a sinkhole, an enemy, etc.) and the user is allowed to test locations by entering coordinates.  The game provides some feedback about each guess, such as the distance to an obstacle, the number of nearby obstacles, or something else.  The next time the grid is printed, it also reflects what the player has learned about the contents of the grid squares.  You can determine the best win/loss logic, based on what turns out to be fun; examples:  (1) Must locate an obstacle within a fixed number of moves to win; (2) Must avoid all obstacles and find all other squares to win; (3) After a limited number of moves, the number of obstacles found is the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interactive fiction bot** - A program that reads a JSON file in the format used for the world map in Project 2 and determines whether or not it is possible to win the game.  If it is possible, the program prints a list of commands that will result in a win.  If it is not possible, the program prints a message to that effect.  Along with the actual program, two JSON data files are included: A map where winning is possible, and another where it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Digging around in the standard library** - Select a module from the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) that we don't cover in class.  Learn about it and write a program that demonstrates its major features in a natural, coherent way.  (The details will depend on the module, but what you submit shouldn't be a random assortment of lines of code involving that module.  Instead, it should do something in which the use of the module arises naturally.)  It would be a *very* good idea to check with the instructor by email when you're considering a specific module and before writing the full proposal.  Some of the standard library modules would work well, others less so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lexicon hornet** - The New York Times has an online spelling game called [*Spelling Bee*](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) in which players must spell words using a given collection of 7 letters, one of which is required to be used.  Make a game similar in concept, but distinct in the details.  For example, it might provide 8 letters the player is allowed to use to make words while designating two of them that are required to be present.  You will need to find an open source dictionary text file to use in checking answers, and will need to manually decide on some sample letter sets to provide with the game.  While the NYT game is played in a browser, a project on this topic would be expected to use a terminal (text + keyboard) interface instead.\n",
