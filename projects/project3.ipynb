    "### Make some tests\n",
    "The functions in your module `dynam` probably won't work perfectly the first time.  Testing in the REPL is possible, but tedious.   You'd need to open the Python interpreter, import the module, define a function of an integer argument, and then apply one of the functions from `dynam` to the function you defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the autograder as your only way of testing has its own problems: It isn't available until Nov 1, it's slow, and if your program has unexpected types of errors (like syntax problems), it can be hard to understand where the problem is based on the autograder's report.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these reasons, you should test your work locally, on whatever computer you use to write code.  Submit to the autograder when things appear to be working locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "For local testing, I recommend you make a script called `test_dynam.py` that imports `dynam`, defines some functions of an integer argument to use with it, and then calls various functions from `dynam`.  It should probably print the results.  That way, each time you finish a function in `dynam`, you can save it, run `python3 test_dynam.py` in the terminal, and see if the results match your expectations.\n"

    "## IMPORTANT: Code structure and style requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required header\n",
    "The first three lines of your Python program must be comments in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# MCS 260 Fall 2021 Project 3\n",
    "# Full Name\n",
    "# REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR INDIVIDUAL WORK DECLARATION\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second line, replace `Full Name` with your full name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third line, replace the all-caps comment with a single full sentence, written in your own words, explaining that makes an accurate statement about whether or not you completed the project individually and followed the rules in the syllabus and project description.\n",
    "\n",
    "These comments should be immediately followed by a file-level docstring (as explained below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `dynam.py` must have a docstring at the file level (i.e. first statement must be a string literal describing what it does).\n",

    "\n",
    "Importing the module `dynam` shouldn't do anything other than define functions.  It's a really good idea for you to write code to test the functions, but that should either be in another file or protected by the `if __name__==\"__main__\":` idiom so it only runs when `dynam.py` is the main script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use good variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to choose variable names that communicate a variable's purpose in a concise way, but without being too terse.  Uninformative low-effort names like `intvar` or `mystring` are not acceptable.  Single-letter variable names can be used, but sparingly, and should usually be avoided for lists or other complex data structures.  Most of the time, a good variable name will be a single word or compound word, like `cycles` or `iterates`, but descriptive multiword names are also acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use comments to explain, not to disable code\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged, but not required, to include comments that contain explanatory text.\n",

    "5. Operational tests (at least two tests for each function, **40 points total**): The autograder will call functions from your module on sample inputs and test they they produce the expected output.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Manual review: 5 points\n",
    "\n",
    "I will review your code and look for adherence to the style guidelines given above, and examine your method for accomplishing the requested task in each function.  If I see a function does not do what was requested in this document, but the error was not detected in the automated testing, a deduction may be given at this point.  The scores assigned by the autograder will not be changed during manual review unless I discover some kind of intentional wrongdoing (such as an attempt to circumvent or reverse-engineer the autograder's operation)."
