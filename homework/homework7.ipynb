    "\n",
    "Modify the sample program [parentheses.py](https://github.com/emilydumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/parentheses.py) we developed in class to create a new program called `hwk7prob2.py` that knows about both brackets `[`,`]` and parentheses `(`,`)` and can check for proper matching in an expression that may contain both.  Brackets can match brackets, and parentheses can match parentheses, but a bracket cannot match a parenthesis.  There's no restriction on which grouping symbol can be used inside the other, so all of these expressions are valid:\n",
    "* `[(1+2) - (3+4)]`\n",
    "* `([1 + (2-3)]+4)`\n",
    "* `[5 * [6 - 7]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there are three kinds of errors that the program needs to be able to report:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Too many left delimiters: some brackets or parentheses remain open at the end of the expression, e.g. `[(1+2)-3` or `([5+6]`\n",
    "1. Too many right delimiters: A `]` or `)` appears when there isn't anything to match it with, e.g. `(1+2)]` or `((1-2)+4))`\n",
    "1. Delimiter type mistmatch: A `]` would match an earlier `(`, or a `)` would match an earlier `[`, e.g. `[1+2)` or `((5+6)-7]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two errors are also present in the example `parentheses.py`, but the third type is new to this modified version of the program and you need to add code to detect and report it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The basic structure of the program won't change very much, but you *will* need to change what is stored on the stack.  The original `parentheses.py` stores a position (integer), and that's no longer enough information. I suggest you make it so that instead of pushing an integer onto the stack, the new program pushes a list like `[\"(\",7]` or `[\"[\",5]` that indicates both the delimiter type (first element) *and* the position in the string (second element).  This will, of course, change the way you access the position when you pop something off the stack.  Another option is to push a dictionary like `{\"delimiter\": \"(\", \"position\": 7}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VERY IMPORTANT:** For full credit, you must not leave any comments or docstrings in `parentheses.py` that are inaccurate because of your changes.  Whenever you edit a program, you need to make sure you edit any comments that are affected by your changes!"

    "\n",
    "You can use the CSV example above as the content of a file `elements.csv` for testing purposes, but your program needs to be able to handle any CSV file listing chemical elements in that format (with three columns, \"number\", \"abbreviation\", and \"name\", appearing in that order).\n",
