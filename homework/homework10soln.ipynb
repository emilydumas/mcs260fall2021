    "This homework assignment must be submitted in Gradescope by 10am CST on Tuesday, November 2, 2021.\n",

    "### Topic\n",
    "This homework focuses on **object-oriented programming**.  It is a bit shorter than usual to give you more time to work on Project 3.\n",

    "### Collaboration\n",
    "\n",

    "Create a file `hwk10prob2.py` that contains a single class definition, for a class `Element`.  Objects in this class will store chemical elements.  The class should have the following behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The constructor has three required arguments other than `self`.  They are:\n",
    "    * `Z`, the atomic number of the element (a positive integer that uniquely identifies it), e.g. `3`\n",
    "    * `name`, the full name of the element, e.g. `Lithium`\n",
    "    * `symbol`, the one- or two-letter symbol used to represent the element, e.g. `Li`\n",
    "* The constructor stores its arguments as attributes of `self`, so e.g. an `Element` object `e` has attributes `e.Z`, `e.name`, and `e.symbol`.\n",
    "* The `__str__` method returns a string representation in this format: `Lithium (#3)`.  (It doesn't print anything, it just returns the relevant string.)\n",
    "* The `__repr__` method returns the same thing as `__str__`.  (It doesn't print anything, it just returns the relevant string.)\n",
    "* The `==` operator is overloaded by a method `__eq__` of this class, which checks whether the object this element is being compared to has the same atomic number, returning a boolean.  If the other object has a different atomic number, or if it isn't an instance of class `Element`, then this method should return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is some test code that should work once you've defined this class, and the expected output is shown below it.  **Don't include this code in your submission. Use it to test your work, but then only submit `hwk10prob2.py` containing a single class definition.**\n",
