    "## Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first homework where you'll write Python code, so the instructions are detailed and long.  The actual problems are brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deadline\n",
    "This quiz must be submitted in Gradescope by 10am CST on Wednesday, September 8, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic\n",
    "This quiz is about the topics of worksheet 2, i.e. **variables**, the built-in types **int**, **float**, and **string**, and the use of **booleans and conditionals**.\n",

    "### Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
