    "## Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first homework where you'll write Python code, so the instructions are detailed and long.  The actual problems are brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deadline\n",
    "This homework assignment must be submitted in Gradescope by 10am CST on Wednesday, September 8, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic\n",
    "This homework assignment is about the topics of worksheet 2, i.e. **variables**, the built-in types **int**, **float**, and **string**, and the use of **booleans and conditionals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "\n",

    "At the very end of this document there's some advice about how to work on these problems that duplicates things discussed in Lab 1, Worksheet 1, etc., but which might be helpful."
