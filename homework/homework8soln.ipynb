    "## 2. Robust chemical element CSV to JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Homework 7, problem 3](https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2021/fall/mcs260/nbview/homework/homework7soln.html#3.-Chemical-element-CSV-to-JSON) (titled \"Chemical element CSV to JSON\"), you wrote a program to convert a CSV file containing data about chemical elements to a JSON file.  The program used hard-coded filenames `elements.csv` and `elements.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify this program (either start with one of the solutions posted to the course web site, or your own solution) so that it is robust to all of the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `elements.csv` does not exist\n",
    "* `elements.csv` exists and is a CSV file, but it has fewer than 3 columns\n",
    "* `elements.csv` exists and is a CSV file with columns called `number`, `abbreviation`, and `name`, but some of the values in the column `number` are not integers\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these conditions arises, the program should print an error message describing the situation and then exit without creating `elements.json` nor writing anything to it.\n",

We can use another `try` & `except` statement when opening the file, and a `try` & `except` statement when attempting to read the file's contents, with the latter needing to catch at least two different types of exceptions."

    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Most of the sample programs we've written in lecture contain a comment listing the lecture or lectures in which we worked on or discussed the program.  Usually such a comment looks like this:\n",

    "# Lecture 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "or this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# MCS 260 Fall 2021 Lecture 9\n",

    "### Your task\n",
    "Write a program that prints a list of names of all files in the current directory that meet both of the following criteria:\n",
    "1. The filename ends with `.py`.\n",
    "2. The text inside the file contains the string `Lecture` somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this program, you should probably create another file in the current working directory that ends with `.py` and which contains the string `Lecture` somewhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to split a file into words for this problem; for example, if a file has first line `asdfLecturefghil` and its name ends in `.py`, this program should print its name.\n",
