    "## 2. Multiple delimiter matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the sample program [parentheses.py](https://github.com/emilydumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/parentheses.py) we developed in class to create a new program called `hwk7prob2.py` that knows about both brackets `[`,`]` and parentheses `(`,`)` and can check for proper matching in an expression that may contain both.  Brackets can match brackets, and parentheses can match parentheses, but a bracket cannot match a parenthesis.  There's no restriction on which grouping symbol can be used inside the other, so all of these expressions are valid:\n",
    "* `[(1+2) - (3+4)]`\n",
    "* `([1 + (2-3)]+4)`\n",
    "* `[5 * [6 - 7]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there are three kinds of errors that the program needs to be able to report:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Too many left delimiters: some brackets or parentheses remain open at the end of the expression, e.g. `[(1+2)-3` or `([5+6]`\n",
    "1. Too many right delimiters: A `]` or `)` appears when there isn't anything to match it with, e.g. `(1+2)]` or `((1-2)+4))`\n",
    "1. Delimiter type mistmatch: A `]` would match an earlier `(`, or a `)` would match an earlier `[`, e.g. `[1+2)` or `((5+6)-7]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two errors are also present in the example `parentheses.py`, but the third type is new to this modified version of the program and you need to add code to detect and report it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The basic structure of the program won't change very much, but you *will* need to change what is stored on the stack.  The original `parentheses.py` stores a position (integer), and that's no longer enough information. I suggest you make it so that instead of pushing an integer onto the stack, the new program pushes a list like `[\"(\",7]` or `[\"[\",5]` that indicates both the delimiter type (first element) *and* the position in the string (second element).  This will, of course, change the way you access the position when you pop something off the stack.  Another option is to push a dictionary like `{\"delimiter\": \"(\", \"position\": 7}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VERY IMPORTANT:** For full credit, you must not leave any comments or docstrings in `parentheses.py` that are inaccurate because of your changes.  Whenever you edit a program, you need to make sure you edit any comments that are affected by your changes!"
