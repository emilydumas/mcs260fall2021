    "## 1. Unlimited MWDPS using command line args\n",
    "\n",
    "A [solution to Project 1](https://github.com/daviddumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/mwdps/mwdps.py) was recently posted.  Starting from your own solution or the posted one, make a new program `mwdps2.py` that computes the MWDP sequence but has the following differences in its behavior:\n",
    "1. Instead of asking for the starting number using `input()`, it should expect the starting number to be given as a command line argument.  (If no argument is given, it should notice this and print a usage message.)\n",
    "2. Instead of stopping after 100 iterations, this program should keep computing terms until a loop is found, no matter how long it takes.\n",
    "3. Instead of printing \"looped\" on the last line, it should print a more detailed message in the following format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Looped after 171 terms: Term #171 and term #138 are both equal to 76.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what running the program in the terminal should look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas> python3 mwdps2.py\n",
    "Usage: mwdps2.py N\n",
    "Computes the MWDP sequence starting with integer N.\n",

    "8\n",
    "Looped after 2 terms: Term #2 and term #1 are both equal to 8.\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the program exits when it doesn't receive an integer as a command line argument.  Also, the \"Looped\" message refers to terms using 1-based indices (#1 means the first term, i.e. the command line argument)."

    "## 2. protogrep\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program called `protogrep.py` that searches for all occurrences of a word in a given text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, `protogrep.py` should accept two command line arguments.  The first argument (stored in `sys.argv[1]`) is the word that the program is going to search for (e.g. \"apology\"); we'll call this the **search term**.  The second argument (`sys.argv[2]`) is the name of an existing text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should then open the specified file, read it line by line, and check whether each line contains the search term.  Lines that contain the search term should be printed, and all other lines should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the text file version of Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* we used as an example in lecture (available [here](https://github.com/daviddumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/data/pride.txt)) has 8 lines that contain `apology`, and the program could be asked to print them with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas> python3 protogrep.py apology pride.txt\n",
    "      to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\n",
    "      connection must plead my apology.”\n",
    "      all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\n",
    "      sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology\n",
    "      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\n",
    "      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\n",
    "      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\n",
    "      understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas>     \n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, the text file of Charles Dickens *Great Expectations* (available [here](https://github.com/daviddumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/data/expectations.txt)) has only one line containing the word \"abundance\":\n",
    "```\n",

    "The early dinner hour at Joe’s, left me abundance of time, without\n",

    "Both of the examples shown here assume that the relevant text file has been saved in the same directory as the script `protogrep.py`.  If it is located somewhere else, you'd need to specify the path on the command line, e.g. \n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas\\Desktop\\MCS 260\\worksheet 6> python3 protogrep.py abundance C:\\Users\\ddumas\\Downloads\\expectations.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to do any fancy word splitting in this exercise; it's fine to just test whether the search term appears `in` the string (so e.g. search term `plan` would match a line `I listened carefully to his explanation.`)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Why the weird program name?  There is a popular terminal utility called [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) that searches for text in files.  Because this exercise involves writing a simple Python script that does something similar, but is more basic, we call it \"proto-grep\".)"
