    "In general, the MCS 260 worksheet for any week's lab will cover material up to the Monday of that week; for week 1, this means only lecture 1 is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work on the activities below in lab.\n",
    "* Seek assistance from your TA or from fellow students if you run into trouble.\n",
    "* Start on the software setup tasks, but [skip ahead to the number systems exercises](#Part-II.-Number-systems) if it looks like you are running out of time.  It's important to get practice on both while you have a TA and other students around to offer support and assistance.\n",
