    "## 1. Arithmetic progression reporter\n",
    "\n",
    "An *arithmetic progression* is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any pair of neighboring terms is the same, e.g.\n",
    "$$ 1, 5, 9, 13, 167, 21, ... $$\n",
    "where the difference is 4, or\n",
    "$$ -58, -42, -26, -10, 6, 22, ... $$\n",
    "where the difference is 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arithmetic progression is determined by its first element $a_0$ and the difference $\\delta$ between neighboring terms.  The term at index $i$ then has the formula $a_i = a_0 + \\delta * i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that allows the user to specify an arithmetic progression and a desired number of terms, and which then prints the terms, one per line, as shown below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "First term: -100\n",
    "Difference of neighboring terms: 7\n",
    "Number of terms: 13\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 13 terms of that arithmetic progression are:\n",
    "-100\n",
    "-93\n",
    "-86\n",
    "-79\n",
    "-72\n",
    "-65\n",

    "-44\n",
    "-37\n",
    "-30\n",
    "-23\n",
    "-16\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `-100`, `7`, and `13` on the first three lines are numbers entered by the user.  Note that means your program will have three `input()` statements to read these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "* Use a for loop\n",
    "* No lists are needed or recommended for this program (but there are correct solutions that would use a list)\n",
    "* Do you recall how to iterate over the numbers from 0 to n-1 in a for loop?"

    "## 2. Word list report\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script that lets the user enter any number of words, one per line.  The script should store all of the words the user enters in a list.  When the user is finished, they simply press Enter instead of entering a word, and the script takes this as a signal to stop waiting for additional input.  It then prints a report giving:\n",

    "Hints:\n",
    "* Try to get everything except the total number of letters working first.\n",
    "* At the beginning of the program, you'll want to create a list that is initially empty, and which will store the words as they arrive.\n",
    "* You can use a `while` loop to repeatedly read words until a blank one is found (with `input(...)` in the body of the loop).\n",
    "* But watch out: Variables used in the `while` statement need to exist before the loop begins, and you won't have read the first word when the loop starts.\n",
    "* In lecture 5 we learned how to add an element to the end of a list."

    "## 3. Puzzle box\n",
    "\n",
    "You are presented with a wooden box.  Across the top, it has a row of five light bulbs.  (To be able to refer to the lights individually, let's call them 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.)  Lights 1 and 2 are turned on when you first receive the box.  Below the lights is a label that reads \"Puzzle Box - Can you turn on all of the lights?\"  There are also two large circular buttons, labeled \"a\" and \"b\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You discover that pressing button \"a\" makes the state of the lights shift one position to the right, with the rightmost light's state wrapping around to the left side.  In other words, after pressing button \"a\", light $n$ will be in whatever state light $n-1$ was in before you pressed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also discover that pressing button \"b\" makes lights 0, 2, and 4 switch state (from on to off or off to on, whichever is appropriate for the light).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before trying out the physical puzzle, you decide it would be best to experiment on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python script that simulates the puzzle box, displaying the state of the lights using 0 and 1 to represent off and on, respectively.  The script should keep showing the state of the lights and waiting for a button press until the user wins (i.e. until the state is `11111`.) Here's what the interface should look like (and a sample of how you might win):\n",

    "* You want to end the game when the lights are all on; what type of loop makes this easiest?\n",
    "* You'll need to read a button from the user using `input(...)` and then decide which of two things you need to do to modify the light state list.  What Python construct is best for that?\n",
    "* If you want to print a digit and not skip to the next line, you can use `print(x,end=\"\")`.  For example, compare the two programs shown below."
