    "\n",
    "Hot and humid air often feels hotter than hot dry air, in part due to slower evaporation of perspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason it can be helpful to describe weather conditions in terms of a **heat index**, a number which attempts to capture the \"perceived temperature\" by incorporating both the air temperature and relative humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several heat indices that are in common use, and in this problem we'll look at one of them.  The formula for it is described in https://www.weather.gov/media/ffc/ta_htindx.PDF, and adapted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose the temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit, is $T$\n",
    "* Suppose the relative humidity percentage is $R$\n",
    "* Then the heat index $H$ is given by the formula\n",

    "where the coefficients $c_0, ..., c_8$ have the values\n",
    "  * $c_0 = -42.379$\n",
    "  * $c_1 = 2.04901523$\n",

    "  * $c_8 = -0.00000199$\n",
    "  \n",
    "Write a Python script called `heatindex.py` that asks the user for the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity percentage (as two separate input events).  The script should then print the heat index.  Specifically, running `python heatindex.py` should result in prompts and output like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter temperature (degrees F): 92\n",
    "Enter relative humidity (percent): 60\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that you are not supposed to write a program that uses fixed numbers like 92 and 70 for the temperature and humidity, though that would be a reasonable start.  A completed program is supposed to accept whatever numbers the user types and do the calculation with those values."
