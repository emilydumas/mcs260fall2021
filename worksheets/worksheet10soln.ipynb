    "## 1. Segment class\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to the classes discussed in our OOP lectures (for geometric objects Circle and Rectangle), create a Python class called Segment to store a line segment in the plane.  The constructor should accept four arguments: x0,y0,x1,y1.  The point (x0,y0) is then one endpoint of the segment, and (x1,y1) is the other endpoint.  All four constructor arguments should be stored as attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following methods should be included:\n",
    "* `translate(dx,dy)` - move the segment horizontally by `dx` and vertically by `dy`.  This should modify the object, not returning anything.\n",
    "* `scale(factor)` - increase the length of the segment by a factor of `factor`, keeping the center point the same.  **This is tricky, because the center point is not part of the data stored in the class!  Feel free to skip this at first and come back to it later.**\n",
    "* `__str__()` - make a reasonable human-readable string representation that includes the values of x0,y0,x1,y1.\n",
    "* `length()` - returns a float, the distance between the endpoints of the segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, read the next problem before you start work on this."

    "Multiplying two quantities with units results in an answer that has a different unit.  For example, 11 kilograms multiplied by 20 seconds is equal to 220 kilogram-seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it does make sense to multiply a quantity with units by a number that has no units at all.  For example, if you have 16 apples that each have a mass of 0.1 kilograms, then the total mass is (0.1kg)\\*16 = 1.6kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add an operator overloading feature to `QuantityWithUnit` that allows such a quantity to be multiplied by a number as long as it is not an instance of `QuantityWithUnit`.  If you do this correctly, then the following tests should behave as the comments suggest.  These assume that you have `QuantityWithUnit` in a module called `qwu`."
