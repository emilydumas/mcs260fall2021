    "\n",
    "In Lecture 17, we wrote a program [parentheses.py](https://github.com/daviddumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/parentheses.py) to examine mathematical expressions like `((1+2)+3)` and check that it is possible to match the parentheses up in pairs.  It uses a stack to keep track of all the unmatched left parentheses while scanning through the string.\n",

    "## 2. TV Episodes: From JSON to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2010 to 2012, the National Geographic Channel produced a weekly hour-long TV series titled \"Python Hunters\".  While you might imagine this was a show about computer programming, it was actually about snakes.\n",

    "\n",
    "(This is not an official reference, but a user-generated catalog from a web site called TVMaze.  They make such datasets available for anyone to use, for free, as long as they give proper attribution.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to need this data file in this problem, so you should visit the link and save it somewhere (e.g. as `pythonhunter.json`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON object in this file is a list, and each item in the list is a dictionary describing an episode .  All of the dictionaries have the same keys, which are characteristics of an episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same information could be presented in table form and stored in a CSV file.  For example, if the only characteristics of an episode we care about are:\n",
    "* season\n",
    "* number\n",
    "* name\n",
    "* airdate\n",
    "\n",
    "then the episodes could be listed in a CSV file that would look like this:\n",

    "season,number,name,airdate\n",
    "1,1,The Perfect Storm,2010-07-12\n",
    "1,2,The Big Freeze,2010-07-19\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program `episodes_to_csv.py` that reads the JSON file containing the episode list and creates a CSV file in the format described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python's `json` module to read the JSON file, and use the `csv` module to write the CSV file.  CSV is simple enough that you could probably write the data in this format manually (i.e. with `file.write()`), but the point of this problem is to get some practice using the `csv` module."
