    "Write a Python program `showsearch.py` that takes a command line argument, the *search string*, and looks for a TV show with a name similar to that string.  The program should print a list of possible matches with info about each one, ordered from most likely match to least likely.  This could be used to convert a partially-remembered name (e.g. \"I remember it had the word 'foundation' in it\") to detailed info like title, date, and streaming service.  Here's an example of what it should look like when it is run:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds like a nearly impossible task, but there's a free and open API that does all the heavy lifting.  TVMaze provides a HTTP API where the URL specifies a TV show search string, and the response contains a JSON object that is a list of possible matches.  Each one has a **score** (indicator of likelihood of match to the search term), and lots of data about the show (genre, start date, duration of episodes, web page, description, etc.).  All you need to do is fetch the data using `urllib.request.urlopen(...)`, process the JSON, and extract the info you need to print the possible matches.\n",
