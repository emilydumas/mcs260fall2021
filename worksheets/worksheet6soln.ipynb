    "## 1. Unlimited MWDPS using command line args\n",
    "\n",
    "A [solution to Project 1](https://github.com/emilydumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/mwdps/mwdps.py) was recently posted.  Starting from your own solution or the posted one, make a new program `mwdps2.py` that computes the MWDP sequence but has the following differences in its behavior:\n",
    "1. Instead of asking for the starting number using `input()`, it should expect the starting number to be given as a command line argument.  (If no argument is given, it should notice this and print a usage message.)\n",
    "2. Instead of stopping after 100 iterations, this program should keep computing terms until a loop is found, no matter how long it takes.\n",
    "3. Instead of printing \"looped\" on the last line, it should print a more detailed message in the following format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Looped after 171 terms: Term #171 and term #138 are both equal to 76.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what running the program in the terminal should look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas> python3 mwdps2.py\n",
    "Usage: mwdps2.py N\n",
    "Computes the MWDP sequence starting with integer N.\n",

    "8\n",
    "8\n",
    "Looped after 2 terms: Term #2 and term #1 are both equal to 8.\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the program exits when it doesn't receive an integer as a command line argument.  Also, the \"Looped\" message refers to terms using 1-based indices (#1 means the first term, i.e. the command line argument)."

    "Write a program called `protogrep.py` that searches for all occurrences of a word in a given text file.\n",

    "Specifically, `protogrep.py` should accept two command line arguments.  The first argument (stored in `sys.argv[1]`) is the word that the program is going to search for (e.g. \"apology\"); we'll call this the **search term**.  The second argument (`sys.argv[2]`) is the name of an existing text file.\n",

    "      to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\n",

    "      sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology\n",

    "      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\n",

    "      understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\n",
    "PS C:\\Users\\ddumas>     \n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, the text file of Charles Dickens *Great Expectations* (available [here](https://github.com/emilydumas/mcs260fall2021/blob/main/samplecode/data/expectations.txt)) has only one line containing the word \"abundance\":\n",

    "You don't need to do any fancy word splitting in this exercise; it's fine to just test whether the search term appears `in` the string (so e.g. search term `plan` would match a line `I listened carefully to his explanation.`)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Why the weird program name?  There is a popular terminal utility called [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) that searches for text in files.  Because this exercise involves writing a simple Python script that does something similar, but is more basic, we call it \"proto-grep\".)"
