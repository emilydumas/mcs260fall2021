    "## 1. Arithmetic progression reporter\n",
    "\n",
    "An *arithmetic progression* is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any pair of neighboring terms is the same, e.g.\n",
    "$$ 1, 5, 9, 13, 167, 21, ... $$\n",
    "where the difference is 4, or\n",
    "$$ -58, -42, -26, -10, 6, 22, ... $$\n",
    "where the difference is 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arithmetic progression is determined by its first element $a_0$ and the difference $\\delta$ between neighboring terms.  The term at index $i$ then has the formula $a_i = a_0 + \\delta * i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that allows the user to specify an arithmetic progression and a desired number of terms, and which then prints the terms, one per line, as shown below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "First term: -100\n",
    "Difference of neighboring terms: 7\n",
    "Number of terms: 13\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 13 terms of that arithmetic progression are:\n",
    "-100\n",
    "-93\n",
    "-86\n",
    "-79\n",
    "-72\n",

    "-23\n",
    "-16\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `-100`, `7`, and `13` on the first three lines are numbers entered by the user.  Note that means your program will have three `input()` statements to read these data.\n",

Lights 1 and 2 are turned on when you first receive the box.  Below the lights is a label that reads \"Puzzle Box - Can you turn on all of the lights?\"  There are also two large circular buttons, labeled \"a\" and \"b\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You discover that pressing button \"a\" makes the state of the lights shift one position to the right, with the rightmost light's state wrapping around to the left side.  In other words, after pressing button \"a\", light $n$ will be in whatever state light $n-1$ was in before you pressed it.\n",
    "\n",

    "Write a Python script that simulates the puzzle box, displaying the state of the lights using 0 and 1 to represent off and on, respectively.  The script should keep showing the state of the lights and waiting for a button press until the user wins (i.e. until the state is `11111`.)
