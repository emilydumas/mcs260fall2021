Here's one way to do that:  Outside the function, make a list `L` that is initially empty.  Inside the function `fib`, make the first line append a value to `L`.  Then, after calling `fib`, the length of `L` is the number of calls to `fib`.  Of course, you'll need to reset the list `L` to be empty before calling `fib` again if you want to count the number of calls for another starting value of `n`.\n",
