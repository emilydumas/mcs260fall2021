    "\n",
    "We covered a lot of new ground last week.  This worksheet focuses on:\n",
    "* functions\n",
    "* dictionaries\n",
    "* additional features of strings (e.g. `.split()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`)\n",
    "* the math module\n",
    "* the random module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work on the exercises below during lab.  Complete them afterward if you don't finish during the lab period.\n",
    "* This worksheet will prepare you for the upcoming homework assignment.\n",
    "* Most of the exercises ask you to write Python scripts to accomplish a certain task.  We recommend making a folder (with a name like \"worksheet5\") to store the scripts you prepare today.\n",
    "* Seek assistance from your TA or from fellow students if you run into trouble.\n",

    "## Collaboration\n",
