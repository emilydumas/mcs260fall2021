    "* **Tuesday lab students:**  Problem 1 will be presented and solved as a group, in a discussion led by your TA.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want to pass multiple items to a function, there are essentially two ways to do it:\n",
    "1. Pass them all in one \"box\", i.e. as a single list or iterable (like `f( [1,2,3] )`)\n",
    "1. Pass each item in its own argument (like `f(1, 2, 3)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we want to make a function `numberedprint` that prints a numbered list of items.  For example, if the items are `a`, `b`, and `c` it might print:\n",

    "#1: a\n",
    "#2: b\n",
    "#3: c\n",

    "OR\n",
    "```\n",

    "and have it produce the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the function should do the following:\n",
    "* If more than one argument is given, the function should assume that each argument is one of the items\n",
    "* If a single argument is given, the function should assume that this argument is an iterable whose elements are the items.\n",
    "    * However, if an attempt to iterate over the only argument doesn't work, the function should go back to assuming the argument is the (one and only) item.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you are taking a class called NDT 371 that gives a homework assignment each week, each of which asks you to write a Python script.  For some reason, the problems are always numbered 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being an enterprising student who is familiar with Python's `os` module, you decide to make a quick Python script that will generate template Python files for each problem on each homework.  That way, when the homework is assigned, you just open the two files and get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create that script.  Specifically, it should do the following:\n",
    "* Check to see if there is a subdirectory called `ndt371` in the current directory.\n",
    "    * If it does not exist, create a subdirectory with that name.\n",
    "* For each homework number N (between 1 and 15) and each problem number P (between 8 and 9), see if a file called `hwkNprobP.py` exists **in the subdirectory** `ndt371`.  Here, the N and P should be replaced with the actual numbers, so the filenames will be like `hwk7prob8.py` and so on.\n",
    "    * If no file with that name exists, create one (opening it for writing) and write the following text before closing it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"\"\"DOCSTRING GOES HERE\"\"\"\n",
    "# NDT371 Fall 2023\n",
    "# Firstname Lastname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    * But if a file with that name already exists, the script should leave it alone and print a warning to the terminal, like\n",

    "Not creating ndt371/hwk3prob8.py: A file with that name already exists\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this function will behave differently the first time it is run (when it will make all the templates).  If you immediately run it again, it should simply warn you that all the templates exist, and not do anything to the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully test the program, you should run it several times, including under these conditions:\n",
    "* Make sure no `ndt371` subdirectory exists, and confirm it makes one with all the template Python files\n",
    "* Then, delete everything in `ndt371` but leave the directory itself, and confirm it still creates the files\n",
    "* Then, delete just a few of the files in the directory, and confirm it recreates those while leaving the existing ones untouched\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful opening files for writing.** This problem specifies behavior where you check to make sure a file does not exist before you open it for writing, to avoid data loss.  This problem was purposely formulated to use filenames that probably won't be the same as programs you make for this class, just in case you make a mistake and write a program that clears some files contents.\n",
