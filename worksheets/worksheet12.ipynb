    "Matches the string `fact`, optionally followed by an underscore and another word consisting of latin alphabet letters, followed by a pair of parentheses with an integer between them.  No spaces are permitted anywhere.\n",

    "### Example 1 solution\n",

    "Matches `fact_recursive(5)` or `fact(15)` or `fact_iterative(0)`, but does not match `fact()` or `fact_ (2)` or `fact_recursive( 67 )`.\n",

    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "`(xx)+x([yz][yz])*`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2 solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Matches an odd number of `x`s, requiring at least three to be present, followed by an even number of letters that are all `y` or `z`.  It is permissible to not have any `y` or `z` there at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion:** This would match `xxxzy` or `xxxxx` or `xxxzzyyzy` but not `x` or `xyz` or `xxxxyy`.  Note that the highlighter on [pythex.org](https://pythex.org) will highlight the first match it finds, and ignore any other match that overlaps with it.  So if you test this expression with string `xxxxyz`, it will highlight the initial `xxx` match, even though there is also `xxxyz` later in the string which matches as well (but overlaps the first one)."
