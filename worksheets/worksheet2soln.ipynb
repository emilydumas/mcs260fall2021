    "Hot and humid air often feels hotter than hot dry air, in part due to slower evaporation of perspiration.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several heat indices that are in common use, and in this problem we'll look at one of them.  The formula for it is described in https://www.weather.gov/media/ffc/ta_htindx.PDF, and adapted below.\n",

    "where the coefficients $c_0, ..., c_8$ have the values\n",
    "  * $c_0 = -42.379$\n",

    "Write a Python script called `heatindex.py` that asks the user for the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity percentage (as two separate input events).  The script should then print the heat index.  Specifically, running `python heatindex.py` should result in prompts and output like the following:\n",
