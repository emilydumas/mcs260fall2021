    "If you want to pass multiple items to a function, there are essentially two ways to do it:\n",
    "1. Pass them all in one \"box\", i.e. as a single list or iterable (like `f( [1,2,3] )`)\n",
    "1. Pass each item in its own argument (like `f(1, 2, 3)`)\n",

    "#2: b\n",
    "#3: c\n",

    "More precisely, the function should do the following:\n",
    "* If more than one argument is given, the function should assume that each argument is one of the items\n",
    "* If a single argument is given, the function should assume that this argument is an iterable whose elements are the items.\n",
    "    * However, if an attempt to iterate over the only argument doesn't work, the function should go back to assuming the argument is the (one and only) item.\n",

    "* Then, delete everything in `ndt371` but leave the directory itself, and confirm it still creates the files\n",
    "* Then, delete just a few of the files in the directory, and confirm it recreates those while leaving the existing ones untouched\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful opening files for writing.** This problem specifies behavior where you check to make sure a file does not exist before you open it for writing, to avoid data loss.  This problem was purposely formulated to use filenames that probably won't be the same as programs you make for this class, just in case you make a mistake and write a program that clears some files contents.\n",
